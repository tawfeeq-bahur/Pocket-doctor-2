    ```
    [User's Browser] <--> [Next.js Frontend (React)] <--> [Next.js Server (API Routes/Server Actions)] <--> [Genkit AI Flows] <--> [Google AI Platform (Gemini)]
    ```

*   **Flow of Data**
    1.  **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the React components in the browser.
    2.  **Frontend to Backend:** Client-side requests (e.g., asking the AI assistant a question) are sent to Next.js Server Actions.
    3.  **Backend to AI:** The Server Action calls a Genkit flow.
    4.  **AI Processing:** The Genkit flow constructs a prompt and sends it to the Google Gemini model.
    5.  **Response:** The AI model returns a structured JSON response, which is sent back through the chain to the frontend and displayed to the user.
    6.  **State Management:** All application state (like the medication list) is managed on the client-side using React Hooks and Context for a fast, responsive experience.

*   **External Services Used**
